While \cite{pei_real-time_2025} have achieved good results using only tank
levels and pump speeds, we show that it is beneficial to include other sensor
information that can be available in real world scenarios such as pressure
sensors. Enforcing limited pump switch to improve applicability remains a
challenge for future work.
%However, as is well-known in the RL community, agents can learn unfeasible policies in simulated environments. Hence, it is important to check the applicability of the learned policies to real life, e.g. no quick succession of switches in the pump states.
%Building on our experiments we plan to extend our research to bigger networks and sparser but more deliberate sensor configurations.
